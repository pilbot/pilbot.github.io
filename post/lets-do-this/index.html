    <br> <div class="text-justify">

<p>Welcome to hopefully the first of a series of posts detailing my battles
with technology. Trying to plug all the things together and make them play nice,
and hopefully no big explosions. Always remember folks in infrastructure,
<a href="https://youtu.be/Wpzvaqypav8?t=1064">“If anything exciting happens, we&rsquo;ve done it wrong”</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.conversocial.com">We</a> have recently been working on improving our
test infrastructure. Previously this was a large bash script (as all the best
projects are 😉) running within a single job on a <a href="https://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins CI</a>
server. These tests are a mix of integration tests and unit tests, using
<a href="https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">nose</a> for the backend tests and
<a href="https://facebook.github.io/jest/">Jest</a> for the frontend. The backend tests
require a load of initialization for the associated services (e.g mySQL,
MongoDB, Solr, RabbitMQ) before the test suite is run and a load of cleanup
afterwards. Including running the test suite this was taking in the region of
25 minutes, which invariably leads to <a href="https://xkcd.com/303/">distracted developers</a>.</p>

<p>The main requirements we had for a new system were:</p>

<ul>
<li>It needed to be a drop in replacement in our build pipeline (e.g. there
should be minimal changes outside the test infrastructure)</li>
<li>The testing infrastructure should be easy to update and kept in SCM</li>
<li>The tests should run in under 10 minutes</li>
</ul>

<p>Given these restrictions, we decided to go was to keep using Jenkins CI and
use the <del>Workflow plugin</del> <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Plugin">Pipeline plugin</a>
to break up the test script into smaller executable chunks. The next part of
the puzzle was to use <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/"><code>docker-compose</code></a>
to manage the running of test services so that multiple instances of the tests
could be run at the same time on one machine without interfering with one
another<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Luckily the service requirements could all be described as
a one-to-many relationship from the test node, which simplified matters somewhat.</p>

<h3 id="dockerizing-the-test-services">Dockerizing the test services</h3>

<p>We store this configuration with the code repository, thus the storing the
tests and associated configuration not only in one location but in lockstep with
each commit of the code.</p>

<p>The next part was relatively straight forward, in fact in most cases we could
simply use the images that were contained on the docker registry. Using docker
volumes to link to any required configuration:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">mongo:
  image: mongo:3.0
  command: --smallfiles

mysql:
  image: mysql:5.6
  environment:
    - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=secrets
  volumes:
    - ./deploy/mysql/conf.d:/etc/mysql/conf.d
</code></pre>

<p>For the test node itself this was slightly more complex as it needed to be able
to access the other service containers as well as being built from a specific
<code>Dockerfile</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">test:
  image: $2
  links:
    - mongo:mongo
    - mysql:mysql
    - redis:redis
    - solr:solr
</code></pre>

<p>The primary reason for using this method is to prevent the explosion in number
of images created on the same box when running multiple instances, and also so
when we move to multi-node we can grab the image from our registry rather than
building it on each box.</p>

<p>Putting this all together we can construct a simple script to be run in
the checkout stage of the job. Firstly we would build from pre-made
<code>Dockerfile</code>s the custom images we need and then output the correct
docker-compose file to STDOUT:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">#!/bin/bash

short_hash=`git rev-parse --short HEAD`
build_tag=&quot;$(date -u +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)-master-$short_hash&quot;
docker build -t test:$build_tag .

cat &lt;&lt;EOF
mongo:
  image: mongo:3.0
  command: --smallfiles

mysql:
  image: mysql:5.6
  environment:
    - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=secrets
  volumes:
    - ./deploy/mysql/conf.d:/etc/mysql/conf.d

test:
  image: test:$build_tag
  links:
    - mongo:mongo
    - mysql:mysql
EOF
</code></pre>

<p>Once we had this model in place it was easy enough to run multiple builds
concurrently on the same instance without interfering with another test cycle,
and relatively little performance impact, so while we could now run parallel
builds we were still in the mid-twenty minutes per run range.</p>

<h3 id="designing-a-build-flow-with-jenkins-pipeline">Designing a build flow with Jenkins pipeline</h3>

<p>Next we needed to get these tests quicker, the one long running script wasn&rsquo;t
cutting the mustard anymore and needed to be sped up. The first part of this
was to develop a simple model of how the tests should run:</p>

<p><img src="/images/build-flow-design.png" alt="Build Flow Design" /></p>

<p>The basic model shows ideally we would start by checking out all the required
code for the test run, building the required docker images to run the tests,
run all the tests, then collecting and publishing the results and artifacts.</p>

<p>Using the pipeline model we use the <code>stage</code> step to separate the
job into sections:</p>

<p><img src="/images/build-flow-stages.png" alt="Build Flow Stages" /></p>

<p>Each <code>stage</code> will run until all parts of that stage are complete before moving
to the next stage. The pipeline model unfortunately doesn&rsquo;t have a good way of
fork/joining a job into complex workflows like we have described. So we end up
waiting for parts of the job we are not dependent on. For example, there is no
reason to wait for the frontend tests to complete if the docker images are
already built we should be able to start testing the backend immediately<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="starting-docker-from-the-pipeline">Starting docker from the pipeline</h2>

<p>First we have two companion functions to bring up and destroy the containers
using the <code>sh</code> function and <code>docker-compose</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-groovy">def startDockers(project){
  // stop and destroy any existing containers
  destroyDockers project
  sh &quot;docker-compose -p ${project} up -d&quot;

  // check that databases are accessible from within the container
  timeout(time: 60, unit: 'SECONDS') {
    sh &quot;docker exec ${project}_test_1 /bin/bash -c 'while ! /usr/bin/mysql -uroot -psecrets -hmysql -P3306 -t -e \&quot;show databases;\&quot; &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1; do sleep 5; done;'&quot;
    sh &quot;docker exec ${project}_test_1 /bin/bash -c 'while ! curl http://mongo:27017/; do sleep 5; done;'&quot;
  }
}

def destroyDockers(project){
  sh &quot;docker-compose -p ${project} stop &amp;&amp; sudo docker-compose -p ${project} rm -f&quot;
}
</code></pre>

<p>As <code>docker-compose</code> doesn&rsquo;t have a concept on waiting on dependent services we
use the <code>timeout</code> workflow step to check they are up before returning to the
main flow.</p>

<p>So to run a group of the backend tests within a container we can use a <code>node</code>
like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-groovy">node {
  dir('checkout') {
    // where checkout is a frozen git repository
    unstash 'checkout'
    try {
      startDockers 'tests'

      // Run the test command within the container
      sh &quot;docker exec tests_test_1 /bin/bash -c 'cd /srv/app/; /srv/app-venv/bin/python manage.py test || true'&quot;

      // Copy results from the container
      sh 'docker cp tests_test_1:/srv/app/nosetests.xml results.xml'
      stash name: &quot;results&quot;, includes: &quot;results.xml&quot;
    } finally {
      destroyDockers 'tests'
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>By using a <code>try</code>-<code>finally</code> we can ensure that if the tests fall over or are
aborted externally then the containers are still cleaned up.</p>

<p>While testing we found that docker images and volumes would hang around,
unfortunately we still don&rsquo;t live in a world with infinite disk space and
found that fairly frequent cleanup is a necessity. Something like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">docker volume ls -qf dangling=true | sudo xargs -r sudo docker volume rm
docker rmi `sudo docker images -f dangling=true -q --no-trunc`
</code></pre>

<p>seems to do the job fairly well, while leaving the core images that don&rsquo;t change
per-build in place.</p>

<p>Again this offered comparable performance with the initial runs still hitting
the mid-twenty minute range, however as the pipeline model allows the scripts
to be stored in SCM we fulfilled one of the other requirements.</p>

<h2 id="using-jenkins-pipeline-to-run-tests-in-parallel">Using Jenkins Pipeline to run tests in parallel</h2>

<p>Up until this point all the effort has been into containing the build within its
own isolated environment allowing multiple instances to run concurrently. To
speed up the execution of a single build we can use the <code>parallel</code> step.
Expanding upon the previous code running within a docker container parallelise
the backend tests by adding:</p>

<pre><code class="language-groovy">stage name: 'test backend'
def numOfNodes = 8
// This function is documented below. But it returns a list of lists of
// modules to test. (e.g [&quot;foo bar baz&quot;, &quot;quz bam zoo&quot;, ...])
def testGroups = groupModulesToTest(readFile(&quot;results.xml&quot;), numOfNodes)
tasks = [:]

// Within workflow we have to use this style for-loop because JENKINS-26481
for (int i = 0; i &lt; testGroups.size(); i++) {
  String moduleList = testGroups.get(i)
  String nodeName = &quot;${env.BUILD_ID}backend${i}&quot;
  tasks[&quot;test_${nodeName}&quot;] = {
    node {
      dir('checkout') {
        unstash 'checkout'
        try {
          startDockers nodeName
          // Run the test command within the container
          sh &quot;docker exec tests_test_1 /bin/bash -c 'cd /srv/app/; /srv/app-venv/bin/python manage.py test ${moduleList} || true'&quot;

          sh &quot;docker cp ${nodeName}_test_1:/srv/conversocial/src/nosetests.xml results.xml&quot;
          stash name: &quot;${nodeName}_results&quot;, includes: 'results.xml'
        } finally {
          destroyDockers nodeName
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
parallel tasks
</code></pre>

<p>This will split into <code>numOfNodes</code> groups (e.g. 8 in this example, should be Set
to the total number of executors to get best parallelism) and run a different
group of tests on each of the nodes.</p>

<p>This blog post won&rsquo;t go into the details of the best way to get the list of
evenly distributed test groups but the following is a start, simply breaking
up the tests per top level module:</p>

<pre><code class="language-groovy">/**
 * Returns groupings of a modules to test.
 *
 * @param xml String containing the text from a JUnit file.
 * @param numGroups Number groups to divide the tests into.
 */
@NonCPS List&lt;String&gt; groupModulesToTest(xml, numGroups){
  def testsuite = new XmlSlurper().parseText(xml)
  def allModules = testsuite.testcase.collect {
    it.@classname.toString().tokenize('.')[0]
  }.toSet()
  def int numPerGroup = Math.ceil(allModules.size() / numGroups)
  allModules.toList().collate(numPerGroup).collect { group -&gt;
    group.join(' ')
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>groupModulesToTest</code> function takes a JUnit test file as input. In our case
this can be generated before from the <code>--collect-only</code> argument that can be
passed to <code>nose</code>. However, in other cases it might be wise to balance them from
previous test runs; particularly if there is a large time variance across all
the tests.</p>

<p>This part had the biggest win on performance, this cut the test time down to
around 8 minutes! However, when lots of people were running the tests at the
same time, on the single instance, this could climb to double that. This
pointed out that we had perhaps put too many executors on the instance we were
using (in AWS this was an <code>m4.2xlarge</code> @ 12 executors). But looking at the load
of each executor is important, where before each would be running a single
process each were now responsible for 3 containers.</p>

<h2 id="going-multi-node">Going multi-node</h2>

<p>While it seems like every week AWS releases a new instance type
(<code>m4.10xlarge</code> FTW! 😎) eventually our number of tests is going to
overtake even this. It would be better if the tests could be run across multiple
systems. Natively the pipeline plugin supports this, however, by adding docker
to the mix we added another dependency. Because the images that we build must
be available from any node that wants to run there needs to be a mechanism to
share these before. Along comes docker registry, but it does need a bit of a
re-jig of the test pipeline and we need to move the pushing of docker images
to into the building part of the job, they are then available for
any node from the registry.</p>

<p>Using the syntax:</p>

<pre><code class="language-groovy">node('master') {
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>operations can be locked to the master node. We found it improved performance
when checking out the repositories if it was always on the same node,
similarly for the building of the docker images. Additionally this means that
only the master node has rights to checkout the repository and push to the
registry which might be useful from a security perspective.</p>

<p>After doing this the tests now can run on any number of hosts. In AWS, we found
that running the master on a reserved instance and the group of supporting
servers on a <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/DeveloperGuide/US-SpotInstances.html">spot instance-based auto scaling group</a>
as they are stateless and can be destroyed at any time, and are significantly
cheaper than their on demand counterparts<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding Thoughts</h2>

<p>Hopefully this post has been useful, and it has highlighted two distinct
approaches that can be used in conjunction to give a fast, scalable model for
running tests without need to change any of the core code in your application.</p>

<p>The first part is to isolate tests to allow them to work side by side, allowing
many instances of the test suite to run concurrently, so many developers can
run their tests at the same time.</p>

<p>The second is to parallelise the running of those tests so that many groups of
tests can run at the same time, allowing the length of time to wait for tests
to become a business decision over a technological one.</p>

<p>Finally we actually meat our goals:</p>

<p>✅ A drop in replacement in our build pipeline</p>

<p>✅ Testing infrastructure should be easy to update and kept in SCM</p>

<p>✅ The tests run in under 10 minutes, from the recently
open-sourced <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Stage+View+Plugin">stage-view plugin</a>:</p>
