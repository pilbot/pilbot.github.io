      <description>In the most controversial political move this century the Pok√©mon company has stated that in the Galar region we no longer &amp;ldquo;Gotta catch &amp;lsquo;em all&amp;quot;‚Ñ¢, in fact we can&amp;rsquo;t they won&amp;rsquo;t all be available!
Since the number of Pok√©mon in Kanto and Dunbar&amp;rsquo;s number are approximately equal I think that is a fair number of older Pok√©mon that will make it across the border. I&amp;rsquo;m assuming in Galar the legendary creatures can get a special visa or something.</description>

      <description>Welcome to hopefully the first of a series of posts detailing my battles with technology. Trying to plug all the things together and make them play nice, and hopefully no big explosions. Always remember folks in infrastructure, ‚ÄúIf anything exciting happens, we&amp;rsquo;ve done it wrong‚Äù.
We have recently been working on improving our test infrastructure. Previously this was a large bash script (as all the best projects are üòâ) running within a single job on a Jenkins CI server.</description>
